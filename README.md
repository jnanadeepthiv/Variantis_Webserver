## **Key Features**  

### **1. Transition and Transversion Analysis**  
- Calculate **transition (Ti)** and **transversion (Tv)** ratios for DNA sequences.  
- Generate a **nucleotide matrix** for comparative analysis.  
- Colour coded  alignment for individual pairs.
- Summary matrices of the all the sequences.

### **2. User-Friendly Interface**  
- Intuitive design for easy navigation and file upload.  
- Customizable parameters for advanced users.  

### **3. Flexible Input Options**  
- Supports **FASTA format** files with extensions: `.fasta`, `.fas`, `.fa`, `.fna`, `.ffn`, `.frn`.  
- Allows users to adjust **gap open** and **gap extend** parameters for alignment.  

### **4. Automatic Algorithm Selection**  
- Automatically selects the optimal alignment algorithm based on sequence length:  
  - **EMBOSS Needle** for sequences ≤ 3,000 bases.  
  - **EMBOSS Stretcher** for sequences > 3,000 bases.  
- Rejects files with sequences exceeding **10,000 bases** to ensure optimal performance.  

### **5. Detailed Results**  
- Provides **alignment files**, **processed FASTA files**, and **nucleotide matrices** for download.  
- Visualizes individual nucleotide changes for in-depth analysis.
